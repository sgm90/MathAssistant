# MathAssistant

This project uses PostgreSQL. Before running the program, you need to install PostgreSQL and create the necessary database and user.

## Installing PostgreSQL

Detailed instructions for installing PostgreSQL can be found on the official PostgreSQL website.

## Creating the Database and User

After installing PostgreSQL, you can create the database and user by running the following script, you will need your SU password to run it.

## Notes

Mathematical tasks are quite difficult, I hope the logic of solving the task will be evaluated, because I only partially completed it.

```bash
./create_db.sh
```
